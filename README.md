👋 Hi, I’m @nickspiess, I'm a developer and soon-to-be-graduate from Eau Claire, WI and I'm looking to move out to Colorado.
👀 I’m interested in Brain-Computer Interface tech, the blockchain industry, and getting into full-stack development.
🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow, Keras and EEG signal analysis for a Motor-Imagery BCI System and the IBM Hyperledger framework.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything biofeedback or blockchain related
