👋 Hi, I’m @nickspiess, I'm a Python developer and graduate from UW-Eau Claire where I studied computer science and neuroscience.
👀 I’m interested in Brain-Computer Interface tech, blockchain technologies, and getting into full-stack development.
🌱 I'm currently working on learning the React/Redux framework, on top of a million other side interests.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything biofeedback or blockchain related devices.
