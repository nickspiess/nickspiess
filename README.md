Hi, my name is Nick Spiess.  I'm a 26 year old dev based in Colorado.

I work primarily as a QA Engineer and do freelance web development on the side, check out my portfolio site @ https://www.spiess.tech

The main project I'm working on right now is a marathon training plan generator app.

I am also very passionate about using Deep learning algorithms to monitor bioinformatic neural data.

Feel free to reach out if you share any of the same interests.
