Hi, my name is Nick Spiess.  I'm a 26 year old dev based in Colorado.

I have experience in front-end and back-end technologies, mainly focusing on React frameworks.  I currently work as an Automation Python Engineer and am working on building a small business website.

I am extremely passionate about using Deep learning algorithms to monitor bioinformatic neural data and blockchain technologies.

Feel free to reach out if you share any of the same interests.
